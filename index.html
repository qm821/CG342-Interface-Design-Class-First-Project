            <h2>Gameplay Combat</h2>
            <p>Honkai: Star Rail has a turn-based combat system, which means players must choose what each character is
                to do on the field, and they will execute each action in order, based on their individual speed stats.
                Players that have played any traditional JRPGs, for instance, will understand the combat system in
                Honkai: Star Rail quite quickly. Games like the early Final Fantasy titles follow the same structure.
                However, it is important to point out that there are a few other mechanics that come into play that
                still need to be understood before tackling the game. <a

            <h2>Exploration</h2>
            <p>Players are able to roam around and explore the various areas of the Honkai: Star Rail map for treasure
                chests, enemies, puzzles, and more. However, each area is its own separate zone, so there will be a
                loading screen when traveling between different areas in the overworld.
                When exploring the world, you will select one character out of the four in your team to be your active
                character. The active character is the one on screen that you control. You can switch the active
                character anytime when you are outside of combat. <a

            <h2>How to Obtain</h2>
            <p>Most playable Honkai: Star Rail characters are obtained through the in-game Gacha system, also called the
                Warp system. The main character, known as the Trailblazer, will be part of your roster from the very
                start of the game. They can be male or female depending on the player's choice. This is also the only
                character not available in the Warp system. <a

            <h2>Herta Space Station</h2>
            <p>Not content with the laws of the common world, the Genius Society's Herta set her sights on the
                unexplained existences of the galaxy, expecting those distant mysteries to satisfy her curiosity. To
                this end, Herta led the establishment of a museum-like starship and launched it towards the Star Rail,
                starting the research work to seal all strange existences among the stars. And the famous Herta Space
                Station was born. <a href="https://hsr.hoyoverse.com/en-us/world/101839" class="button-link"

            <p>Traversing across the snow plains, you can get a full view of Belobog, the only spot on the ice-cold
                world of Jarilo-VI that barely fits the definition of "a warm place." As the only remaining city with
                human civilization, Belobog has been given many grandiose titles: the last bastion of mankind against
                the Eternal Freeze, the land blessed by Qlipoth... <a href="https://hsr.hoyoverse.com/en-us/world/101838" class="button-alert" target="_blank">Click here
