            <h2>Gameplay Combat</h2>
            <p>Honkai: Star Rail has a turn-based combat system, which means players must choose what each character is
                to do on the field, and they will execute each action in order, based on their individual speed stats.
                Players that have played any traditional JRPGs, for instance, will understand the combat system in
                Honkai: Star Rail quite quickly. Games like the early Final Fantasy titles follow the same structure.
                However, it is important to point out that there are a few other mechanics that come into play that
                still need to be understood before tackling the game. <a

            <h2>Exploration</h2>
            <p>Players are able to roam around and explore the various areas of the Honkai: Star Rail map for treasure
                chests, enemies, puzzles, and more. However, each area is its own separate zone, so there will be a
                loading screen when traveling between different areas in the overworld.
                When exploring the world, you will select one character out of the four in your team to be your active
                character. The active character is the one on screen that you control. You can switch the active
                character anytime when you are outside of combat. <a
